This documentation pertains to the implementation of the API websocket connection. The documentation for the `dcss-api` can be found [here](https://docs.rs/dcss-api/0.1.0/dcss_api/) for Rust and [here]() for Python. The best way to start is to look at the examples [here](https://github.com/EricFecteau/dcss-api/tree/main/examples) for Rust and [here](https://github.com/EricFecteau/dcss-api/tree/main/python) for Python.
