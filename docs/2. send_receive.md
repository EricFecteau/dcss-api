# Sending and receiving messages

## Introduction

Once [connected](connection.md) to the DCSS webtile, the game will send various messages and will expect some interactions. 

## First messages and anatomy of a message

The first few messages that are received, before the user sends any commands, are the following.

```json
RECEIVED:
    {'msg': 'ping'}
    {'msg': 'lobby_clear'}
    {'msg': 'lobby_complete'}
```

All messages received from DCSS webtiles will have the `msg` dictionary key. This will indicate what type of message it is. The above three are simply information about the connection and the state of the lobby. Other messages will have other dictionary keys for additional information. Once the `lobby_complete` message is received, DCSS is ready to receive the next commands.
